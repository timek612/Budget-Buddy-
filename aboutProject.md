Budget Buddy is a web app with the purpose to help users save money. Users can input their income and amount they'd like to save, enter some recurring expenses, and the outcome is a daily, weekly, and monthly allowance displaying how much they can afford to spend. I know a lot of people have trouble saving money, so I wanted to make this app that can help users track their expenses and affordable spending.
